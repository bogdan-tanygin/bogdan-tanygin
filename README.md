# Bogdan Tanygin

Physicist working at the interface of **soft-matter physics**, **mesoscale modeling**, and **functional materials**.

My research focuses on **aggregation phenomena**, **amphiphilic self-assembly**, and **field-responsive soft matter**, with particular interest in how structure, symmetry, and external fields influence collective behavior at the mesoscale.

I work primarily with **coarse-grained simulation approaches**, including **Langevin and Brownian dynamics**, applied to polymeric, colloidal, and nanoparticle-based systems. My background combines theoretical physics, numerical modeling, and long-term involvement in open-source scientific software.
